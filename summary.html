      <P>
        <h10 id = "header3" class = "text-left" style="">The user research that went into building my portfolio helped me narrow down the features and styling that I wanted to implement and design. I felt that the competitor analysis was very beneficial because it helped me draw inspiration from great designers and guided me to creating an asthetically pleasing portfolio. The user interviews helped me understand what exactly hiring managers and peers were looking for in an online portfolio. With this information, I was more than ready to code my portfolio in an efficient and iterative manner. 
      </h10>
    </P>
    <P>
        <h10 id = "header3" class = "text-left" style=""> The user testing helped me verify that my ideas were being interpreted by actual users the way I wanted my features to be interpreted. By conducting cognitive walkthroughs, I saw in real time how users interacted with my portfolio and got feedback on what to improve on in my portfolio as well as which design choices worked and which didn't.
      </h10>
    </P>

    <P>
        <h10 id = "header3" class = "text-left" style=""> After conducting my user research and user testing, I had a better understanding of what worked in my portfolio and what didn't. The whole process of doing the research first before writing any code definitely made the process more structured and organized. After testing, changes that needed to be made were easier to find and conduct, thus making the entire process an effective iterative process.</h10>

      <!-- userInterviews -->
      <P>
        <h10 id = "header3" class = "text-left" style=""> In my findings, a lot of users told me that my design was very boring or too minimal. It was also mentioned to me that I needed to add a resume link or page. In my contact me page, one of the TA's mentioned that my email link should be a mail-to link. These are a few of the changes that I need to implement in my portfolio.</h10>
      </P>

    <P>
        <h10 id = "header3" class = "text-left" style=""> In the future, I plan on changing up the design to make it less boring but not too drastically. I do like the simple design of my current portfolio and my utiization of Text Based design. I do plan to add a link to my resume or implement it similar to other portfolios and have my resume embedded within the portfolio. Thanks to this class, this porfilio will be with me for the rest of my software engineer career. I'm excited to try and implement different designs and continue the user research and testing process to imrove my portfolio as time goes.</h10>
